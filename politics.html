<button class="accordion"><b><i>EXCLUSIVE: Modi speaks to India Today, not about himself but on real issues</i></b>
</button>
<div class="panel">

<br/>
<br/>
<h3><i>In an exclusive interview to Aaj Tak, PM Narendra Modi spoke on issues ranging from Kashmir, jobs, farmers' crisis, and Pakistan.</i></h3>
<p>
Prime Minister Narendra Modi took credit for taming the inflation dragon, telling the India Today Group that his controversial demonetisation measure played a role in bringing down the prices.<br/><br/>


Inflation, he said, ceased to be an issue during his five-year term.<br/><br/>
 <img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\6.jpg" align="right">


On the burning question of Jammu and Kashmir, the PM vowed to follow the Vajpayee doctrine of <b>"Insaniyat, Jamhuriyat and Kashmiriyat" </b>but with a caveat -- not to let the state to be <b>"emotionally blackmailed by a handful of families"</b>.<br/><br/>

Modi's overarching interview to the India Today Group came on the day when he filed his Lok Sabha nomination from his Varanasi constituency.
<br/><br/>
The Prime Minister spoke about West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, insisting that the TMC leader's political ideology has changed drastically over the past ten years.<br/><br/>

Faced with mounting criticism for fielding Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, he defended the BJP's Bhopal candidate, saying accusations of Hindu terror against her were a malicious attempt to tarnish India's age-old legacy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h3><i>ECONOMY AND NATIONAL SECURITY</i></h3>

The PM rejected opposition accusations that he tried to divert public attention from pressing economic issues to national security, saying his election speeches were largely devoted to concerns of the common masses.<br/><br/>

Modi, however, maintained that national security and terrorism cannot be downplayed in public discourse.<br/><br/>

<b>"Analyse all my speeches. If it's a speech lasting 40 minutes, it would give three to four minutes to national security. The rest is dedicated to housing, farmers, the Pradhan [Mantri] Kisan Samman Nidhi, electricity and roads. You can check it out,"</b> he said.<br/><br/>

The Prime Minister accused the Congress of sidestepping national security as he recalled a series of terror attacks that took place during the UPA rule, including the 26/11 siege of Mumbai.<br/><br/>

Modi spoke about Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday bombings.<br/><br/>

<b>"What happened in Sri Lanka? What was their fault? It was the occasion of Easter. Efforts to revive the message of peace were killed," he continued. "Should we not raise awareness about terrorism, which has become a global challenge? We have to give our viewpoint to the nation. The Congress should be asked why it completely rejected the issue of national security."</b><br/><br/>

When pointed out that unemployment has emerged as a major concern for voters in India Today's Political Stock Exchange surveys, the Prime Minister cited other studies to defend his government's record in creating jobs.<br/><br/>

<b>"Reports by the CII and NASSCOM showed that employment has grown multi-fold. Look at the EPFO, which shows 1.25 crore people joined every year," the Prime Minister said. "Look at the Mudra scheme, which has had 4.25-4.50 crore people receiving bank loans for the first time. Look at any sector. When you see roads, rails being made, are they being built without employment?"</b> he asked.<br/><br/>


Modi spelled out his programme when asked how he planned to generate more jobs if voted to power again.<br/><br/>

<b>"In our manifesto, we focus on the rural economy. In the agricultural sector, we will have to move towards agro-based industry, towards value addition," he offered. "Our development model is clear. We want to build infrastructure meeting global benchmarks. We want to double the number of functional airports. At the same time, we want to double the farmers' income. We want to fulfil the minimum requirements of the ordinary citizens."</b><br/><br/>

The Prime Minister underscored the need to use <b>"real-time information and technology"</b> for better insights into the employment situation. <b>"A committee has been set up in this regard. We are working on it. We tried to complete it earlier but the issue is vast enough. We hope that a mechanism matching global standards would be developed within a year or two."</b><br/><br/><br/><br/>


<h3><i>DEMONETISATION: BOON OR BANE?</i></h3><br/><br/>

The PM stoutly defended his note-ban measure, criticised harshly by his political opponents.<br/><br/>

<b>"Demonetisation was not aimed at elections. But the voters of Uttar Pradesh slapped our opponents with their mandate for using demonetisation as an issue in state elections,"</b> he said.<br/><br/>

Modi described the note ban as an assault on black economy, which he said brought about a radical change in the people's mentality.
<br/><br/>
<b>"We all saw images of cash being seized from the homes of bureaucrats and politicians, cash from their beddings, sacks of cash recovered from garages," he said. "It unearthed Rs 1.30 lakh crore. Benami properties worth more than 50,000 crore were confiscated. The tax net doubled from what it had been for 70 years since independence. Demonetisation was a big attack on black money that changed the country's mindset towards honesty."</b>
<br/><br/>
The economy, he added, also has benefited from his scrapping of high-denomination notes in 2016.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Demonetisation played a role in bringing down inflation,"</b> he remarked.
<br/><br/>
High inflation was one of the key factors that contributed to the fall of the UPA from power in 2014.
<br/><br/>
In his interview, the Prime Minister cited falling prices under his rule as a sign of a robust economy.
<br/><br/>
Modi sought to dismiss criticism that demonetisation and the chaotic introduction of the GST were a drag on the country's growth.
<br/><br/>
"I am very satisfied," he remarked when asked how happy he was with his government's economic management.
<br/><br/>
</b>"Look back at 2014 when inflation made headlines. Today, inflation is no longer being discussed,"</b> Modi said.
<br/><br/>
Remember, several other ruling NDA politicians have so far been modest about hailing low inflation as an accomplishment apparently because falling food prices are also being blamed for lowering farmers' incomes and increasing farm debts.
<br/><br/>
Data shows inflation has more than halved under the Modi's government. It averaged 4.8 per cent over the past five years, down from more than 10 percent during 2009-2013.
<br/><br/>
The Prime Minister wondered why the opposition has <b>"never been asked"</b> about the inflation controls brought about by his government.
<br/><br/>
<b>"You never asked Congress leaders about the fall in prices since 2014. It's difficult for them to lie about it in front of the public,"</b> Modi said.
<br/><br/>


The Prime Minister rebutted expert opinion that the 2016 currency withdrawal led to massive job losses.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Those who say that have no data to support their claims. They wanted an excuse to reject our decision, without evidence,"</b> Modi said.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h3><i>RAIDS A WITCH-HUNT?</i></h3>
<br/><br/>
The PM denied suggestions that the ED and the IT were being misused to target opposition leaders.
<br/><br/>
<b>"I urge you all to expose Modi if ever he is found to be involved in any such [illegal] activity. Build pressure so much so that the government is forced to raid Modi's home," the Prime Minister remarked. "Have the [recent] raids not yielded cash recoveries? Is that not a serious question? How can I allow the plunder of resources meant to feed the poor?"</b>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h3><i>INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY</i></h3>
<br/><br/>
Modi dismissed opposition charges that his government destroyed the autonomy of various institutions of Indian democracy.
<br/><br/>
Instead, the PM accused his rivals of denigrating the same institutions.
<br/><br/>
<b>"They are the people who found the EVMs and the Election Commission okay after the Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh elections," Modi argued. "If a Supreme Court decision favours them, they'll be okay with the Supreme Court judges. If not, they'd have Supreme Court advocates sign proposals to bring in an impeachment process in Parliament. It's they who have brought institutions under threat."</b>
<br/><br/>
The Prime Minister insisted that he firmly believe the judiciary should stay independent. <b>"I lived all my life that way. As Gujarat chief minister, I quietly drove to a police officer, who interrogated me for nine hours. That's because I respected an institution. All citizens, political leaders are required to honour institutions, especially those sitting in the government."</b>
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

<h3><i>JAMMU AND KASHMIR</i></h3>
<br/><br/>
Modi espoused the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's doctrine to resolve the protracted Kashmir problem.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Only Atalji's formula can work -- Insaniyat, Kashmiriyat, Jamoohriyat has to work,"</b> he said.
<br/><br/>
But the PM, at the same time, accused the Valley's high-profile political families of holding the entire state to ransom.
<br/><br/>
<b>"I always had a fair understanding of Kashmir. It didn't need to come from my five years in governance,"</b> Modi said when asked if he has figured out any specific approach to deal with the issue while being in national power since 2014.
<br/><br/>
He recalled the time he spent in Jammu and Kashmir for organisational assignments.
<br/><br/>
"I used to work there for the organisation. I visited the state's every district. I know all the fine things," Modi said.
<br/><br/>
But the Prime Minister attributed the instability in the state to what he called the <b>"double-speak"</b> of political families from the valley.
<br/><br/>
<b>"A handful of families have used Jammu and Kashmir for emotional blackmail,"</b> the PM said.
<br/><br/>
He described the BJP's alliance with the PDP -- now broken -- as a <b>"maha-milavat" </b>(adulteration) of divergent ideologies.
<br/><br/>
<b>"We expected that Mufti Sahab would help us come out of it. But that turned out to be a maha-milavat [adulteration]. It was like a mixture of oil and water," he continued. "Still we went for it but acknowledged that both of us are poles apart. There was no other option but to follow the people's verdict. So we went along. Then we left it for the sake of democracy."</b>
<br/><br/>
The Prime Minister challenged the mainstream regional parties of Jammu and Kashmir to stick to one stand in Srinagar and in Delhi.


<br/><br/><b>"The double-speak of the handful of families, who speak one thing in Kashmir and the other in Delhi, has to be exposed. And that is what I am doing," he said. "Theirs is a double-speak. They should have the courage to say the same thing in Kashmir as well as in Delhi and vice-versa. But they don't. They speak two languages and are getting exposed."</b>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h3><i>MODI ON DIDI</i></h3>
<br/><br/>
In the wake of his comments to actor Akshay Kumar that the West Bengal CM still gifts him kurtas, the Prime Minister explained that their political views were at variance with their personal ties.
<br/><br/>
Modi quoted BJP veteran LK Advani's blog to suggest that he considered nobody his <b>"enemy"</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Advani ji wrote a very good blog, which sums up our fundamental character -- we don't consider anyone our enemy,"</b> Modi said.
<br/><br/>

He recounted the TMC leader's 2009 calls to deport illegal Bangladeshis, her calls against violence and her demands to hold elections in West Bengal under the President's rule.
<br/><br/>
<b>"But it's the same Mamataji under whose rule killings are taking place every other day. This leaves me to wonder which Mamata Didi is this. That's worrisome. I never imagined that she would change so much. I have said it publicly that my assessment of Mamata ji has proved wrong."</b>
<br/><br/>

The Prime Minister recalled accusations he faced as Gujarat chief minister as he defended Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur's candidacy for Bhopal.<br/><br/>

<b>"I faced so many allegations. A wave was built against me. If you look at newspapers and online media, you'd find lakhs of pages written against me. That's what influenced the United States to revoke my visa," the PM noted. "But when the truth came out, the same United States extended an invitation to me. It's the Congress modus operandi to propagate lies."</b>


<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h3><i>SWACHH BHARAT AND INDIA TODAY</i></h3>
<br/><br/>
In his remarks, the PM praised India Today Group Chairman and Editor-in-Chief Aroon Purie for promoting the Swachh Bharat Mission.
<br/><br/>
<b>"I'd like to compliment Aroon Purie. He worked on swachhta [the clean-India campaign] with as much honesty as Modi did. The country benefited from it, not Modi,"</b> the PM said.

<button class="accordion"><b><i>As Priyanka Gandhi reveals Congress' strategy of fielding 'weak candidates' in UP to cut BJP votes, Akhilesh Yadav says party giving excuses</i></b>
</button>
<div class="panel">

<br/><br/>
<b>Lucknow:</b> Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s claim to have fielded weak candidates to eat into BJP’s vote share in the Lok Sabha poll in the state has not cut any ice with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who sees her statement as an <b>“excuse”</b> since the <b>“people are not with them"</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>“I cannot believe in these types of statements. I do not believe that the Congress has fielded weak candidates anywhere. No party does it. People are not with them. That is why they are making excuses,”</b> Yadav told ANI in an exclusive interview.
<br/><br/>
Priyanka on Wednesday had said in Raebareli that her party had fielded some candidates in UP with an aim to cut into BJP’s vote share. <b>“Congress will win on the seats where our candidates are strong. Where our candidates are slightly lightweight, they will cut into BJP’s vote share,”</b> she told media persons. 
<br/><br/>
When asked about political analysts’ claim that the coalition is the <b>‘Team B’</b> of the Congress, Yadav, also former UP chief minister, claimed that there was no difference between the BJP and the grand old party. <b>“There is no difference between the BJP and the Congress. Congress wants to benefit the BJP,”</b> he said. <b>“Who taught the central agencies to intimidate Opposition leaders? The BJP has learnt to misuse the Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation and other agencies against leaders in opposition from the Congress,”</b> he said.
<br/><br/>

 <img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\7.jpg" align="right">

 <br/><br/>
 <b>“The person who filed PILs against Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and me was present at the nomination of Lucknow Congress candidate,”</b> he said. He also debunked Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s claim that BJP controls the SP and the BSP. <b>“No one controls us. We are political parties. It is the SP, BSP and RLD alliance in UP that is poised to give a setback to the ruling party,”</b> Yadav said. He termed SP-BSP-RLD alliance as the glue that is connected to the people on the ground. <b>“Our alliance will stop the bad policies of the BJP.”</b>
<br/><br/>
Exuding confidence that the alliance would bag the maximum number of seats in the state where 80 seats are at stake, Yadav said: <b>“It is one of the reasons that the BJP leaders do not talk about development in their rallies and seek to divert the people’s attention.” “The alliances in several states have choices but the BJP does not have any other leader. Our alliance wants to give India a new prime minister. My party will decide about the prime minister when the final seat tally is out,”</b> he said when asked who will be the prime minister if the BJP does not come to power.
<br/><br/>
Asked if his father and former defence minister Mulayam Singh Yadav will be a prime ministerial candidate, Yadav said: <b>“It will be good if Netaji gets the honour (to be the prime minister) but I feel he is probably not in the prime ministerial race.”</b> When asked about his national ambition, the 45-year-old leader said that he only wants his party to contribute in the new government at the Centre and made it clear that he is focusing at the Assembly elections, which are due in 2022. <b>“I want to appeal to the people of Uttar Pradesh to give us one more chance to further our programmes which has been stalled,”</b> he said.
<br/><br/>
<b>“However, I want to increase the number of SP’s MPs in the Lok Sabha. I want to be among those who want to make a new prime minister. I want Uttar Pradesh to contribute in the next government formation.”</b> When asked whether he would want her wife Dimple Yadav to be a part of a non-BJP government at the Centre, Yadav said: <b>“I want her to win with a good margin of votes first because Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the DGP of the state want to ensure that she loses.”</b>
<br/><br/>
When asked why he is vehemently critical to Modi while his father is comfortable with him, Yadav said: <b>“Netaji is from a generation when leaders used to respect other leaders irrespective of their party lines. But the behaviour of the BJP leaders towards others is not good.”</b> It is worth mentioning that Mulayam Singh had left all surprised after he sought another term for Modi in February. <b>“I wish that Modi, you should become the prime minister again,”</b> he had said in his intervention in the last sitting of the Lok Sabha.
<br/><br/>
Talking about the way the nomination of Tej Bahadur Yadav was rejected in Varanasi, he criticised Returning Officer (RO) Surendra Singh for not giving adequate time to his party candidate and former BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav to submit a document. <b>“If the DM had any objections, he should have raised when he filed his nomination papers the first time. Had he point out the issue then, he would have produced the document timely. I believe the Supreme Court will deliver him justice,” </b>he said.
<br/><br/>
Talking about controversial remarks made by his senior party leader Azam Khan about Jaya Prada, Yadav defended him saying that sometimes even his legitimate remarks are taken wrongly and maintained that he shares good relation with Azam Khan like his father Mulayam Singh Yadav. Yadav said: <b>“He speaks directly. Sometimes even his legitimate remarks are seen in a bad light. He is as close to me as he is to Neta ji.”</b>
<br/><br/>
The former chief minister, however, declined to comment on the family feud which led to his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav floating a new party. <b>“It is difficult to say whether or not we will unite in the future but at least the people want to know who was at fault,”</b> he said.

<button class="accordion"><b><i>Multiple surgical strikes done during UPA tenure, but never had to hide behind army's valour, says <b>Manmohan Singh</b></i></b>
</button>
<div class="panel">

 <br/><br/>
 Former prime minister Manmohan Singh has said that the Narendra Modi government has publicised surgical strikes in an effort to draw attention away from its many failures.<br/><br/>
 <img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\8.jpg" align="right">
<br/><br/>
In an exclusive interview to Hindustan Times, Singh said <b>"multiple surgical strikes"</b> were done during the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance government which he headed but alleged that never before had an Indian government needed to ride on the achievements of the army as it is doing now.
<br/><br/>
Ever since the 2016 surgical strike, and especially on the campaign trail leading up to and through the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has relied heavily on the alleged success of the Uri and Balakot surgical strikes.
<br/><br/>
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah and several BJP leaders have hit out at Manmohan over his government's allegedly ineffective handling of terror. Shah especially has referred to Manmohan as "mauni baba" — which literally translates to <b>"dumb saint"</b> — multiple times at campaign rallies. In his interview, however, Manmohan seems to have broken his silence and responded conclusively to charges that his government was soft on terror.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Let me remind you that our armed forces were always given a free hand to operationally respond to every threat. Multiple surgical strikes took place during our tenure too. For us, military operations were meant for strategic deterrence and giving a befitting reply to anti-India forces than to be used for vote garnering exercises. In the past 70 years, a government in power never had to hide behind the valour of our armed forces. Such attempts to politicize our forces are shameful and unacceptable. All this is being done to draw the attention away from unpardonable failures of Modi Government on the economic front, on jobs, on rural distress, on MSMEs and the informal sector,"</b> the former prime minister told Hindustan Times' Sunetra Choudhury.
<br/><br/>

The economist also came down heavily on charges of not having reacted with sharpness after the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai. <b>"In the absence of facts, everyone can re-judge history in hindsight. I disagree with the insinuation that we were not ready with military punitive actions...Within 14 days of the Mumbai attack, we got China to agree to declare Hafiz Saeed as a global terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of UN,"</b> he said.
<br/><br/>
On Wednesday, the same committee blacklisted Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar in what BJP brass has already claimed as a personal victory of Narendra Modi's.
<br/><br/>
Manmohan in the interview also said Modi has been riding on the <b>"empty rhetoric"</b> concerning India's national security.
<br/><br/>
His claim of previous surgical strikes echoes one made by Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who in an Udaipur rally before the Rajastan Assembly election in 2018 had said that the Army had conducted three surgical strikes while the UPA was in power but had kept those operations a secret.
<br/><br/>
<b>“Do you know that like Narendra Modi’s surgical strike, (former PM) Manmohan Singh did that three times? When the army came to Manmohan Singh and said we need to retaliate against Pakistan for what they’ve done, they also said we want it to be secret, for our own purposes,”</b> Rahul had said.
<br/><br/>
Congress has also, significantly, appointed Lt Gen (retired) DS Hooda, who oversaw the BJP government's much publicised 2016 Uri surgical strike, to head a task force on national security. Hooda has been among many to allege that the Modi government has disproportionately hyped the strikes.

Mani Bhushan Sharma said he rode the donkey as he wanted to show a mirror to mainstream politicians who consider the common people stupid like donkeys<br/><br/>
 <img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\9.webp" align="right">
 <br/><br/>
 Mani Bhushan Sharma, a 44-year-old resident of Hulasnagar locality in Jehanabad, has a penchant for contesting polls and went to submit his nomination papers as an Independent candidate on Monday, the last day for doing so in Jehanabad seat.
<br/><br/>
He rode a donkey to file his nomination papers to contest the Lok Sabha election, only to be booked under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
<br/><br/>
Sharma said he rode the donkey as he wanted to show a mirror to mainstream politicians who consider the common people stupid like donkeys.
<br/><br/>
He grabbed some eyeballs, but the authorities were not amused by his unusual mode of transport.
<br/><br/>
Circle Officer, Jehanabad Sadar, Sunil Kumar Sah lodged an FIR against him at the Town police station.
<br/><br/>
"It was a flagrant violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. An FIR has been lodged against him.
<br/><br/>
The police will investigate and proceed accordingly," Sah said.
<br/><br/>
As if it was not enough, his nomination papers were rejected on technical grounds during scrutiny on Tuesday, officials said.
<br/><br/>
Local people said, Sharma has a habit of throwing his hat in the ring as an Independent candidate whenever elections are held for the Lok Sabha seat or the Jehanabad assembly segment.
<br/><br/>
Polling for the Jehanabad Lok Sabha seat will be held in the seventh and last phase on May 19

</button>
<div class="panel">
<br/><br/>
Manish Sisodia alleged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had earlier too tried to <b>"buy"</b> AAP MLAs and they were given appropriate response by the public, and claimed that this time also they will get a befitting reply<br/><br/>

 <img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\10.jpeg" align="right">
 <br/><br/>
 ccusing the BJP of indulging in horse trading, AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday alleged that seven of his party MLAs in the national capital have been offered Rs 10 crore each to join the saffron party.
<br/><br/>
The BJP however rubbished the claim terming it <b>"bizarre allegation"</b> and a <b>"desperate bid to gain attention."</b>
<br/><br/>
Manish Sisodia alleged the BJP had earlier too tried to <b>"buy"</b> AAP MLAs and they were given appropriate response by the public, and claimed that this time also they will get a befitting reply.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Since the BJP does not have any development issue to raise, it has now come down to indulging in horse trading by attempting to buy seven of our MLAs at Rs 10 crore each,"</b> he said.
<br/><br/>
Manish Sisodia also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his comment that 40 Trinamool Congress MLAs in West Bengal are in touch with him and will desert their party once the BJP wins the general elections.
<br/><br/>
<b>"It does not suit the prime minister to make such comments. He (Narendra Modi) should realise that India is a democratic country and he is here because of democracy,"</b> the AAP leader said, alleging the BJP is trying to do the same thing in Delhi.
<br/><br/>
Reacting to Manish Sisodia's allegation, Delhi BJP media head Ashok Goyal said, "The AAP is baffled as it is loosing the elections and its leaders are trying desperately to gain attention by making bizarre allegations."
<br/><br/>
<b>"Arvind Kejriwal is not being able to stop the rebellion of AAP MLAs and is dragging BJP's name in their internal problems,"</b> Ashok Goyal said.
