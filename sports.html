</button>
<div class="panel">
After beating Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their own backyard, Rajasthan Royals will return home to keep their chances afloat of making it to the playoffs of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) edition when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), here at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Saturday.
<br/><br/><br/>

Royals are currently placed at the seventh spot with eight points from 11 games and would be looking to take confidence from their three-wicket win at the Eden Gardens in their last encounter.
<br/><br/><br/>
However, they would be missing the likes of Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer who have flown back to England to join the national side for the World Cup camp.
<br/><br/><br/>
On the other hand, SRH, placed at the fourth spot with five wins from 10 games, would want to leave behind the six-wicket win against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and return to winning ways.

</button>
<div class="panel">

<h3><i>Hitman Rohit Sharma smashed a 68-ball 47 and marshalled his troops brilliantly on Friday at Chepauk as Mumbai Indians handed Chennai Super Kings a 46-run thrashing and moved a step closer to IPL 2019 playoffs.</i></h3><br/><br/><br/>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\5.jpeg"></center>


<p>



Do the Avengers need one more superhero to fight Thanos? Well, India all-rounder Hardik Pandya suggests Rohit Sharma, who is popularly known as the Hitman, can join the franchise after the Mumbai Indians captain led the team from the front in their Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019 win over Chennai Super Kings on Friday.<br/><br/><br/>

The MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk was considered the fortress of Chennai Super Kings as the team hadn't lost at the iconic venue in IPL 2019 until Friday. However, Mumbai Indians, led by Hitman Rohit, came up with a dominant show to thrash the hosts and the table-toppers by 46 runs.<br/><br/>

Notably, <b>Mumbai Indians</b> are the only side to have beaten <b>Chennai Super Kings</b> at Chepauk since 2015.<br/><br/>

Responding to Hardik Pandya's tweet, Mumbai Indians' social media handle made a reference to Endgame, the final installment of Avengers that has set box offices across the globe on fire.
<br/><br/><br/>

Rohit Sharma was the star of Mumbai Indians' batting show on Saturday as the opener made a well-paced 67 from just 48 balls on a slow turner in Chennai. Rohit smashed six boundaries and three sixes on a track where some of the best names struggled to put bat to ball.
<br/><br/><br/>
Mumbai Indians posted 155 for 4 in their 20-over quota and their bowlers did a fine job defending what seemed a par-total.
<br/><br/><br/>
<i>In the absence of MS Dhoni who missed Friday's IPL 2019 encounter with illness, Chennai Super Kings never looked comfortable during their chase and were eventually bundled out for 109.</i>
<br/><br/>
Comeback man Murali Vijay top-scored with 38 but Krunal Pandya (2/7) and Lasith Malinga (4/37) ran through CSK's batting order. Stand-in captain Suresh Raina (2), opener Shane Watson (8), Ambati Rayudu (0) and Kedar Jadhav (6) failed with the bat as Chennai Super Kings slipped to a defeat at home for the first time in the season.
<br/><br/><br/>
Rohit Sharma was brilliant with his bowling changes and field placements as the Mumbai skipper walked away with the Man of the Match award as well. Thanks to Rohit's superlative show with the bat, Mumbai climbed to the second spot of IPL 2019 points table and are closer to the playoff spot as well</p>

<button class="accordion"><b><i>'We made mistake, made wrong formations, were a little sloppy': Pochettino</i></b></button>
<div class="panel">



Tottenham were hamstrung by the absence of injured striker Harry Kane and suspended forward Son Heung-min.
<b>London:</b> Mauricio Pochettino took his share of the blame for <b>"sloppy"</b> Tottenham's 1-0 Champions League semi-final first leg defeat against Ajax after admitting he used the wrong tactics.
<br/><br/>
Pochettino's side made a dismal start as Donny van de Beek put Ajax ahead after just 15 minutes at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday.
<br/><br/>

 <center><img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\1.jpeg"></center>

Ajax dominated the first half until <b>Pochettino</b> completely changed his game-plan by switching from a 3-5-2 formation to a 4-4-2 system.
<br/><br/>
Aided by the introduction of Moussa Sissoko for the injured Jan Vertonghen, Tottenham regained a measure of control without ever hurting Ajax with their long-ball barrage.
<br/><br/>
Pochettino conceded he had blundered with his game-plan, but the Tottenham manager was also angry with the lethargic way his players started the club's first European Cup semi-final for 57 years.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Watching now of course I can accept it was a mistake the shape we used. But there were not too many options,"</b> Pochettino told BT Sport.
<br/><br/>
<b>"I am not happy. But our lack of energy from the beginning made our game difficult. We were a little sloppy."</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>"It was not the shape that conceded the goal. Our approach to the game was not good. I am the manager so I have responsibility."</b>
<br/><br/>
Tottenham were hamstrung by the absence of injured striker Harry Kane and suspended forward Son Heung-min.
<br/><br/>
But Sissoko's dynamic contribution and the return of Son for next week's second leg in Amsterdam give Pochettino hope they can still reach the final.
<br/><br/>
<b>"After we conceded the goal, 25 to 30 minutes in, we started to be in the game. Moussa Sissoko provided good energy,"</b> he said.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Second half we pushed them and tried to create chances. It was an even game in the second half."</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>"We are alive. It's only 1-0 down. We need to believe we can go there and win the game."</b>
<br/><br/>
It remains to be seen whether Vertonghen will be fit for the return after the centre-back appeared to suffer a concussion in a clash with team-mate Toby Alderweireld.
<br/><br/>
Vertonghen went off for treatment, but was then surprisingly sent back onto the pitch by Tottenham's medical staff.
<br/><br/>
He looked groggy and on the verge of throwing up before being helped down the tunnel after signalling he couldn't continue.
<br/><br/>
Asked about the severity of Vertonghen's problem, Pochettino only said: <b>"I didn't see him. Of course, we will assess him in the next few days."</b>

<button class="accordion"><b><i>'Kohli and ABD's wickets more satisfying than hat-trick,' says Shreyas Gopal</i></b>
</button>
<div class="panel">


<i>The young all-rounder dismissed these two stalwarts second time in the current IPL.</i>
<br/><br/>
 <center><img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\2.jpeg"></center>
 
 <b>Mumbai:</b> Shreyas Gopal's only allotted over (Tuesday's IPL match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Rajasthan Royals at the M.Chinnaswamy Stradium, Bangalore  was was curtailed to five overs because of rain) saw a hat-trick, which contained the prize wickets of Team India captain Virat Kohli and former South Africa skipper AB de Villers.  
<br/><br/>
It was a satisfying moment for the family of 25-year-old Shreyas.

<br/><br/>
<b>"We are more satisfied with the prize wickets than the hat-trick"</b>, Gopalram Ramaswamy, the father of leg break bowler said exclusively over telephone from Bangalore.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Dismissing Virat and ABD again for the third time was more satisfying".</b>
<br/><br/>
The young all-rounder dismissed these two stalwarts second time in the current IPL. Last year also, he grabbed the prize wickets of these two greats.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Since we didn't win the match (it was abandoned) hat-trick did not give me a great feeling. We could have won the match had the rains not come. Our record against the RCB is very good"</b>, the father added.
<br/><br/>
Shreyas Gopal is a bowling all-rounder. He started off as a batsman. But on the advice of (Rahul) Dravid whyo saw him bowl, he took up bowling seriously.
<br/><br/>
The family would like his son to play for India but the parents wants to ensure that their son focuses only on present.
<br/><br/>
<b>"We always live in present. Every cricketer wants to play for the country and he is no different. But let him focus on his performance. The rest will take care of itself"</b>, the father concluded.

Sindhu, Srikanth aim to regain India Open title</i>
</b></button>
<div class="panel">



With Saina Nehwal pulling out of the tournament due to acute gastroenteritis, the onus lies on Sindhu, Srikanth to keep the flag flying.<br/><br/>



 <center><img src="C:\Users\Haritha\Desktop\p1\Images\3.jpeg"></center>

<b>New Delhi:</b> Former champions P V Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth will look to shrug off their erratic form and ensure an Indian sweep at the USD 350,000 India Open, which is shorn of star power this time.
<br/><br/>
With Saina Nehwal pulling out of the country's blue-riband tournament after failing to recover from acute gastroenteritis, the onus will be on Sindhu and Srikanth to keep the tricolour flying at the business end of the tournament starting on Tuesday.

<br/><br/>
 
 

Olympic silver-medallist Sindhu, who claimed the World Tour Finals in December last year, will be the firm favourite to secure the women's title after receiving the top billing following the pullout of Chinese top seed and reigning All Englang champion Chen Yufei due to medical reasons.
<br/><br/><i>
The absence of Japanese players will also help Sindhu's case.</i>
<br/><br/>
Sindhu had a decent start to the new season with a quarterfinal finish at the Indonesia Masters but a first-round exit at the prestigious All England Championship came as a major jolt.
<br/><br/>
The Indian ace, who won silver medals at the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the World Championship in 2018, will draw inspiration from her performance in the last two editions where she had reached the finals and claimed the title in 2017.
<br/><br/><i>
Sindhu will open against compatriot Mugdha Agrey and is expected to face fast-rising Danish Mia Blichfeldt, seeded eighth, in the quarterfinals. A win is likely to pit her against Chinese third seed He Bingjiao.</i>
<br/><br/>
Youngsters Vrushali Gummadi and Sai Uttejitha Rao Chukka will also be in the fray in women's singles at the World Tour Super 500 event.
<br/><br/>
The tournament will hold a lot of prominence for third seed Srikanth, who has endured a title draught for the last 17 months.
<br/><br/><i>
With defending champion and top seed Shi Yuqi pulling out, Srikanth will be at the forefront along with former world champion Viktor Axelsen, who had claimed the title in 2017 after three back-to-back finals.</i>
<br/><br/>
Srikanth, who clinched as many as four titles in 2017, consistently reached the quarterfinals in 2018 but couldn't come close to claiming a title with the 2017 French Open triumph being his last win.
<br/><br/>
The 26-year-old from Guntur, who clinched the title in 2015, will begin his campaign against familiar foe, Hong Kong's Wong Wing Ki Vincent, and might come across fellow Indians Sameer Verma or B Sai Praneeth later as both are in the same half of the draw.
<br/><br/>
Fifth seed Sameer, after reaching the semifinals at the World Tour Finals, will open against Denmark's Rasmus Gemke, while Praneeth faces a qualifier.<i>
<br/><br/>
RMV Gurusaidutt too is in the same half and will start against Thailand's Sitthikom Thammasin.</i>
<br/><br/>
Praneeth, who had clinched the 2017 Singapore Open for his first maiden Super Series title, is coming into the tournament after securing a final spot at the Swiss Open and he will look to extend his good run.
<br/><br/>
The other half of the men's singles draw will have HS Prannoy, Subhankar Dey, Ajay Jayaram and Parupalli Kashyap.
<br/><br/><i>
Prannoy, troubled by a gastro-esophageal reflux disease last season, is coming to the event after competing at the Asia Mixed Team championship and will take on Thailand's eighth seed Kantaphon Wangcharoen.</i>
<br/><br/>
SaarLorLux Open champion Subhankar, who had stunned Asian Games champion Jonatan Christie of Indonesia on way to a quarterfinal finish at the Swiss Open, will open against fourth seed Indonesian Tommy Sugiarto.
<br/><br/>
Ajay and Kashyap, two careers marred by injuries, will look to continue their comeback with first-round matches against Chinese Taipei's Wang Tzu Wei and Hong Kong's Lee Cheuk Yiu respectively.
<br/><br/>
In doubles, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty withdrew with the former still recovering from a shoulder injury. Sixth seeds Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy will lead the challenge in men's doubles, which also features Arjun MR and Ramchandran Shlok.<i>
<br/><br/>
Arun George and Sanyam Shukla will also be a pair to look out for after they stunned World No. 14 pair of Liao Min Chun and Ching Heng last week at Hong Kong.</i>
<br/><br/>
In women's doubles, Ashwini Ponnappa and N Sikki Reddy and Meghana Jakkampudi and Poorvisha S Ram will be in fray, while Pranaav Jerry Chopra and Sikki will be the best hope in mixed event.
<br/><br/>
